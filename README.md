  # Description 
Amazons evil twin Nozama ! I wanted to eventually open up my own E-Commerce store or help someone build there's so what better way then to model the most successful one of them all ! Of course eventually I intend to give it a new look in version 1.5 right now I'm using Stripe in order to mock an actual transaction right now it's only being ran in test mode right now because I haven't gave it my finishing touches but still you can put in your info or 42 repeating and mock a real transaction (don't expect any of the products to ever get there) you can add as many items as you like with the number of items being added to the cart shown in real time, the checkout page has a calculated total of all the products combined no shipping fee :). When you hit checkout it process the payment and gives you a order receipt, thank you for shopping at Nozama !
